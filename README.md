# AutoPuTTY
is a simple connection manager / launcher
It's written in C# so you'll need some Microsoft .NET Framework

## What you can do with it ##
- Manage a server list and connect thru PuTTY, WinSCP, Microsoft Remote Desktop and VNC (only VNC 3.3 encryption is supported for passwords yet)
- Easily connect to multiple servers at once
- Import a list from a simple text file
- Protect the application startup with a password (note that the list is always encrypted)

## It looks complicated isn't it ? ##
- No, it's not

## So how do I use this ? ##

### Configure tools ###
- Click the "wheel" button and select paths for the tools you want to use, default configuration will run tools from current path (except for RDP which is : %WINDIR%\system32\mstsc.exe) 

### Adding a server ###
- Name and Hostname are required, Username and Password are optional
- Name is unique
- Don't forget the connection "Type", default is PuTTY
- You can import server lists from the Options / General menu ("3 dashes" button)
- SSH jump can be used by adding proxy syntax before the username, it looks like :\
  `proxy_username`@`proxy_host_or_ip`:`proxy_port`#`username`\
  :`proxy_port` and :`proxy_port` are optional, will use port 22 as default

### Connect to a server ###
- Double clicking a server will connect using the associated "Type"
- Right click on a server or a multiple server selection in the list, if you choose "Connect" each will use their associated "Type"

### Modifying a server ###
- Change any of the informations and click the blue "left arrow" button

### Duplicating a server ###
- Change the Name and click the green "plus" button

### Delete a server ###
- Select a server and either click the red "cross" button or right click the server in the list and select "Delete"
- To delete multiple servers, select them then right click on the selection and select "Delete"

### Search servers ###
- Press Ctrl+F, if window size is large enougth, there's a "Match case" option too
